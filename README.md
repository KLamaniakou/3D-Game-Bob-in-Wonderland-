-Game Environment: The game runs at 1024x768 resolution with a dark blue background. The level is an 80x80 square grid on the xz plane, with a textured ground.

-Character Design: Bob is constructed from a sphere (head), a parallelepiped (body), and cylinders (legs), which can move and transform as a single object.

-Game Mechanics: -Bob navigates the ground, unable to exit its boundaries, using keyboard controls.
                 -Interaction with cubes at the level's corners changes Bob's texture or size.
                 
-Camera Implementation: A simple camera allows the player to view the scene from any angle and height, controlled by keyboard arrows and zoom keys
